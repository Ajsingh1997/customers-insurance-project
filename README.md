# Project InsureScore â€“ Customer Risk Profiling & Claim Prediction  

This project builds an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for the insurance sector to **predict claim probabilities, score customers by risk, and flag potential fraud**.  

---

## ðŸ“– Problem Statement  
Insurance companies often struggle with:  
- Identifying high-risk customers.  
- Predicting claim probabilities accurately.  
- Preventing fraudulent payouts.  

**Goal:** Build a predictive and interpretable system that helps insurers optimize pricing, reduce risks, and build trust.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Used  
- **Customer Demographics:** Age, Gender, Region Code, Driving License.  
- **Policy Details:** Annual Premium, Policy Sales Channel, Vintage (tenure).  
- **Vehicle Details:** Vehicle Age, Vehicle Damage.  
- **Target Variable:** `Response` (1 = Claim, 0 = No Claim).

## ðŸ›  Approach  
1. **EDA** â†’ Analyzed customer & claim history.  
2. **Feature Engineering** â†’ Risk features, categorical encoding.  
3. **Modeling** â†’ Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (Ensemble).  
4. **Evaluation** â†’ ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall.  
5. **Risk Scoring** â†’ Probabilities scaled into 0â€“100, grouped as Low / Medium / High risk.  
6. **Interpretability** â†’ SHAP plots & LIME explanations for model transparency.  
7. **Fraud Flagging** â†’ Rule-based + anomaly detection for suspicious cases.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables  
- `final_predictions.csv` â†’ Risk scores, risk buckets, fraud flags.  
- `fraud_flagged_customers.csv` â†’ High-risk, flagged customers.  
- `shap_summary.png` â†’ Global feature importance.  
- `lime_explanation_example.html` â†’ Local explanation of predictions.  

---

## âœ… Outcomes  
- **Risk segmentation** for smarter underwriting.  
- **Claim probability prediction** with high accuracy.  
- **Fraud detection system** to reduce losses.  
- **Explainable AI outputs** for business adoption.
